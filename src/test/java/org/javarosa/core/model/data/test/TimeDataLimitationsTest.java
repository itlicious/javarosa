/**
 This test is intended to show the limitation of {@link TimeData}.

 Using this data type in countries which change their time (summer/winter - DST) will cause that forms saved during
 wintertime and then edited during summertime (and vice versa) will be treated as saved in a neighbor's timezone.
 It's because we have just time and time offset like: 10:00:00.000+02:00 but we don't know when the form has been
 saved so we parse it using the current date.

 Example:
 If we saved 10:00:00.000+02:00 during summertime (in Poland) and we are editing the form during winter time our
 timezone is +01:00 not +02:00. As mentioned above javarosa doesn't know that the form has been saved in the same location
 but different timezone because of DST so it treats the value like saved in the neighbor timezone
 (in Kiev or London for example).
